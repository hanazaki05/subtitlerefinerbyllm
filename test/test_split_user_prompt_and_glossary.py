Ad-hoc test for split_user_prompt_and_glossary() behaviour.

Checks:
- HTML comments <!-- ... --> (single-line and multi-line) are removed.
- Section headers introducing glossary blocks are skipped.
- Lines like "* Term -> 术语" are parsed into glossary entries.
- Remaining non-glossary, non-comment lines stay in instructions.
